General Requirements
------------

Please see the requirements.txt for more of the packages required.

* Python 3.6+
* discord.py[voice] 1.0.0a0+ (Rewrite)

Autorestarting on Linux
-----------------------

This guide assumes that your Linux distribution uses systemd (Example: Ubuntu 15.04 or newer). I am also assuming you have cloned the bot into /home/username/fortnite-bot (where username is some username you chose for the bot account).

Run this command in terminal:
`sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/fortnite.service`

Next, paste the following script, replace, `username` with your linux account name and `usergroup` with your user’s group (usually the same as the username, but you can check with `groups username` in the terminal.)

```bash
[Unit]
Description=fortnite-bot
After=multi-user.target
[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/username/fortnite-bot
User=username
Group=usergroup
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/username/fortnite-bot/bot.py
Type=idle
Restart=always
RestartSec=15

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save with CTRL+O.

You can now start the bot using
`sudo systemctl start fortnite.service`

If you want the bot to start automatically on boot, you can do `sudo systemctl enable fortnite.service`

If you need to view the bot’s log, you can do `sudo journalctl -u fortnite.service`

Other available commands:
`sudo systemctl stop fortnite.service`
`sudo systemctl restart fortnite.service`
